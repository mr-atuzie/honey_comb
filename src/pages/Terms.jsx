          Trading CFDs and foreign exchange on margin carries a high level of
          risk, and may not be suitable for all investors. The high degree of
          leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to
          trade foreign exchange you should carefully consider your investment
          objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility
          exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial
          investment and therefore you should only invest money that you can
          afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with
          foreign exchange trading, and seek advice from an independent
          financial adviser if you have any doubt.

              ● The risks associated with forex trading and cryptocurrency :
            </strong>{" "}
            Forex trading and cryptocurrency are volatile and risky investments.
            The value of currencies and cryptocurrencies can fluctuate wildly,
            and investors can lose a significant amount of money quickly.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-5">
            ● Here are several factors that can contribute to the high risk of
            investing in forex and cryptocurrency:
            <span className=" block my-2">
              <strong>❖ Volatility:</strong> The prices of forex and
              cryptocurrency can fluctuate wildly, making it difficult to
              predict when to buy and sell.
            </span>
            <span className=" block my-2">
              <strong>❖ Leverage:</strong> Forex and cryptocurrency brokers
              often offer leverage, which allows you to trade with more money
              than you have deposited in your account. This can amplify your
              profits, but it can also amplify your losses.
            </span>
            <span className=" block my-2">
              <strong>❖ Liquidity: </strong> The forex and cryptocurrency
              markets are relatively illiquid, which means that it can be
              difficult to buy and sell large amounts of forex or cryptocurrency
              without affecting the price.
            </span>
            <span className=" block my-2">
              <strong>❖ Lack of regulation: </strong> The forex and
              cryptocurrency markets are not as heavily regulated as other
              financial markets, which means more potential for fraud and other
              abuses.
            </span>
          </li>

          <li className=" mb-5">
            <strong>● The registration fee and VAT deduction:</strong> The
            registration fee of 5% and the VAT deduction of 7.5% on withdrawals
            from the platinum package are significant costs that investors
            should be aware of.
          </li>

          <li className=" mb-5">
            <strong>
              ● The potential for losses in the event of unfavorable market
              conditions:
            </strong>
            Investors are responsible for their losses in the event of
            unfavorable market conditions. This means that the company will not
            compensate investors for any losses incurred.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Note:</strong> It is important to carefully consider all of
          the risks involved before investing in the High-Risk Package. You
          should only invest money that you can afford to lose, and you should
          seek independent financial advice before investing.
